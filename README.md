# OnSSET

OnSSET is a Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-based electrification planning tool developed to assess the least-cost pathways for universal electricity access. It models spatially explicit scenarios that combine population distribution, infrastructure, and renewable energy data to suggest the most economical electrification options for each settlement. The tool supports both centralized grid extension and decentralized off-grid solutions over medium- and long-term timeframes.

OnSSET is composed of:

- A Python-based modeling core that performs scenario simulations and optimization  
- A QGIS plugin suite that helps preprocess spatial data and generate model inputs  
- Output CSV files that describe settlement-level electrification strategies and cost metrics  
- Visualization tools that help explore, map, and compare results across scenarios
  
Here you will find everything to install and run OnSSET:
